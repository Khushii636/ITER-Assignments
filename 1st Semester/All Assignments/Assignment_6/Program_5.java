/*A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the 
polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). The formula for computing the area of a regular polygon is Area = ((ùëõ √ó S*S)/(4*tan(pie/n))
 Write a method that returns the area of a regular polygon using the following header: 
public static double area(int n, double side)
